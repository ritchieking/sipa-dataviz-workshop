<p><em>Note: Some of these instructions are blatantly ripped off from Amanda Cox and Kevin Quealy from the New York Times, who taught me how to use Illustrator</em></p>
<p>You&#39;re going to be using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cCwaMRRNYm2hDGA8wq_l1PaBG3ex2Nzsmmrr9N1o7rM/edit?usp=sharing">this data</a> to make a bar chart in Illustrator that looks like this:</p>
<hr>
<p class="img-container"><img src="http://cl.ly/image/1a1z2M1u0E0k/day-one-finished.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>Here&#39;s a reminder of the tools you&#39;ll be using the most:</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="http://cl.ly/image/0E3Y3O2y0x1R/Image%202015-04-19%20at%2012.27.03%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, make sure you can also find the <strong>Color</strong>, <strong>Align</strong>, <strong>Type/Character</strong>, and <strong>Stroke</strong> windows. (If you don’t see these, go to “Window”-&gt; the one you want.)</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol class="list">
<li><p>Create a new Illustrator file by going to File &gt; New. Name it &#39;Mobile-Banking&#39; and set the profile to Web (which will set the units to pixels and the color mode to RGB). Then set the size to 640 x 480 (this will change the profile to &quot;[Custom]&quot;, but never fear - the document will still use pixels and RGB). Click OK.</p>
<p> <img src="http://cl.ly/image/0w2k3F041U0c/Image%202015-04-19%20at%2012.32.49%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Click on the <strong>Graph Tool</strong> and hold the button down until you see a menu pop up with different chart types. Select <strong>Bar Graph Tool</strong>.</p>
<p> <img src="http://cl.ly/image/3D1H3Z12343U/Image%202015-04-19%20at%2012.21.17%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Draw a box with the Bar Graph Tool on your artboard. (Don&#39;t worry too much about the size — you can adjust that later). Paste in the mobile banking data, in the order that you want it to be in — regions first, followed by developing economies and high-income economies. You can paste the values for World in last... this ultimately won&#39;t be a bar, of course, but it makes it easier if you create one on the chart; later you can draw a line that is flush with the end of that bar and be confident that your line is in the right position.</p>
<p> <img src="http://cl.ly/image/261K1O1H172d/Image%202015-04-19%20at%2012.47.23%20PM.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Pro-tip: Now you should make a copy of the chart and keep it off to the side of your artboard. That way, if one of the rectangles gets messed up at any point, you&#39;ll have a clean version to go back to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To make the chart look good, you need to ungroup it. With the chart selected, type Cmd+Shift+G (or go to Object &gt;Ungroup). Don’t worry about the warning; that’s why we made a copy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that the chart is ungrouped, you can delete the axis, and resize the bars using the Selection Tool</p>

</li>
<li><p>Go ahead and finish up the chart to make it match the chart at the top of the page (or mess around with your own styles and annotations, if you&#39;d like), using these pointers:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Use the Type tool to add or edit text.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Arial and Arial Bold for now, and at least 13px font.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can use the pen tool to draw little pointers to interesting things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Hint: to draw a line for the World overall, you can use the Pen tool. Follow the smart guides (in green) and click to draw a point that is lined up with the edge of the World bar, then hold down shift, move the mouse up and click again at the top of the Sub-Saharan Africa bar</p>

</li>
<li><p>When you&#39;re done, you can export the image by going to File &gt; Save For Web (or by contorting your hand to push Cmd+Opt+Shft+S)</p>
</li>
